Feature:
  In order to see idea needs
  As a user
  I should be able to access API idea needs

  Scenario: As a non logged-in user I can see all enabled needs
    When I send a "GET" request to "/api/ideas-workshop/needs"
    Then the response status code should be 200
    And the response should be in JSON
    And the JSON should be equal to:
